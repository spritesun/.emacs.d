;;
;; This style is for the "seamless" embedding of generated EPS images
;; into LaTeX source code.  Please see the README and INSTALL files
;; for further instruction.
;;
;; Please use the usual configure script for installation: more than
;; just Elisp files are involved: a LaTeX style, icon files, startup
;; code and so on.
;;
;; Quite a few things with regard to preview-latex's operation can be
;; configured by using
;; M-x customize-group RET preview RET
;;
;; Please report bugs with M-x preview-report-bug RET
